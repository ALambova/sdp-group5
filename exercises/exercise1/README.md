#### Problem: 

Implement the Breadth-First Search algorithm in order to find the shortest path from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1) in a nxn matrix with walls.  
Output the length of one of the shortest paths (if there are more than one) and the matrix with a symbol '#' for every position of the path

Example Matrix:  

6x6  
.....*  
***.**  
....**  
*....*  
***..*  
***...  

Example Output:  

11  
####.*  
***#**  
*..#**  
*..##*  
***.#*
